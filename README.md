## Trying the app

Follow these steps to try the app locally:

* [Install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install)
* Clone this directory
* Go to the project directory
* Run this command as administator/sudo: `meteor`
* In your browser go to the address Meteor outputs (probably, `http://localhost:3000`)

> **Note:** Features that involve email services like verification and password reset won't work in local build. We used a Meteor package and that package supports production builds only.
